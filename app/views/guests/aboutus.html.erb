</div>

	<p class="alert alert-info">Once upon a time, we lived in Gatineau, Quebec and dreamed of a slower pace... and sunnier climes. After many trips to several different islands, we set our sights on St. Maarten, which turned out to be the best decision we ever made! We have been living here since September 2008 and are in our late thirties</p>

			We live in a 3500 sq. ft. 4-bedroom villa. Your bedroom opens to the terrace, where a very large infinity pool, a jetted plunge pool and lounge chairs are at your disposal. The house sits on a cliff by the sea, so you have an amazing ocean view from your bedroom and you can hear the waves crashing right down below. The tradewinds are constant, so the A/C is rarely necessary. However, you can also use the independently-operated A/C unit in your bedroom if you prefer your room cooler. Your bedroom also has a complete private bathroom with large shower, a king-size bed and a minifridge. Linens, bath and beach towels, a hairdryer and some toiletries are provided. We serve fresh croissants, tropical fruits, orange juice and coffee or tea in the morning.

			Hi there! I am a professional translator by trade. As you will see when meeting the rest of our family, I am a major animal lover. Most of the time, you will find me at my desk working away. I look forward to hearing from you and customizing a package just for you. I hope to see you soon!

			Hello! I am a professional web developer, and I also have a black belt in jiu-jitsu... so you better pay your bill before you leave! Just kidding! Actually, I do have a black belt in jiu-jitsu and would be happy to give you self-defence classes during your stay. I can also be your driver, tour guide and concierge if you want me too... or I can make myself scarce and stay out of your hair if you prefer privacy.

			Fripouille and Fripon are two male Indian ringneck parrots. They cannot talk yet but is still pretty young. They are both a little timid with strangers but enjoy green beans and hot peppers from our garden, as does Ziggy. All three birds love to sing and dance when they see wild birds flying by. We get lots of sea birds by the way... pelicans, seagulls, frigates, etc. We even have a wild macaw regularly flying with the seagulls in the neighbourhood.
